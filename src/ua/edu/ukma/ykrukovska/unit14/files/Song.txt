I could live on bread and water 1
In the desert or mountains, just living with a goal 2
Without gadgets, coffee, comfort, warmth 1
Without brand clothes and live as a beggar 2
But how could I live without you? 1
Tell me how I could live without you? 2

You gave me your wings of Angel 1
I am flying above the world as white bird 2
I love and I will have enough strength 1
To carry you on my hands all my life 2

I could live without whisky or wine
Without long sleep, without expensive property
Without blue sea, without good roads
Without good word, without my arms and legs
But how could I live without you?
Tell me how I could live without you?

You gave me your wings of Angel
I am flying above the world as white bird
I love and I will have enough strength
To carry you on my hands all my life

You gave me your wings of Angel
I am flying above the world as white bird
I love and I will have enough strength
To carry you on my hands all my life
