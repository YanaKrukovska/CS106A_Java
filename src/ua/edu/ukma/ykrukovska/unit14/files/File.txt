Iacould live on bread and water
Inathe desert or mountains, just living with a goal
Withoutagadgets, coffee, comfort, warmth
Withoutabrand clothes and live as a beggar
Butahow could I live without you?
Tellame how I could live without you?

TEST me your wings of Angel
Iaam flying above the world as white bird
Ialove and I will have enough strength
Toacarry I on my hands all my life

Iacould live without whisky or wine
Withoutalong sleep, without expensive property
Withoutablue sea, without good roads
Withoutagood word, without my arms and legs
Butahow could I live without you?
Tellame how I could live without you?

TEST me your wings of Angel
Iaam flying above the world as white bird
Ialove and I will have enough strength
Toacarry I on my hands all my life

TEST me your wings of Angel
Iaam flying above the world as white bird
Ialove and I will have enough strength
Toacarry I on my hands all my life
